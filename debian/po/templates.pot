"The resolvconf package contains the infrastructure required for dynamic "
"updating of the resolver configuration file. Part of the necessary "
"infrastructure is a symbolic link from /etc/resolv.conf to /etc/resolvconf/"
"run/resolv.conf. If you choose this option then this link will be created; "
"the existing /etc/resolv.conf file will be preserved as /etc/resolvconf/"
"resolv.conf.d/original, and will be restored if this package is removed."

"Declining this option will prevent future installations from recreating the "
"symbolic link and therefore the resolver configuration file will not be "
"dynamically updated. Dynamic updating can then be activated following "
"instructions in the README file."

"Once resolvconf is installed, interface configurers supply name server "
"information to it (which it then makes available to the C library resolver "
"and to DNS caches). However, they do this only when they bring up "
"interfaces. Therefore for resolvconf's name server information to be up to "
"date after initial installation it is necessary to reconfigure interfaces "
"(that is, to take them down and then to bring them up again) and to restart "
"DNS caches."

"If the original static resolver configuration file (/etc/resolv.conf) "

"If you choose this option, a temporary workaround will be put in place: a "
"symbolic link will be created (if it does not already exist) from /etc/"
"resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/tail to /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/original. "
"This will cause the whole of that original resolver configuration file to be "
"appended to the dynamically generated file."

"After the required \"dns-nameservers\" lines have been added to /etc/network/"
