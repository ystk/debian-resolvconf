_Description: Prepare /etc/resolv.conf for dynamic updates?
 The resolvconf package contains the infrastructure required for
 dynamic updating of the resolver configuration file. Part of the
 necessary infrastructure is a symbolic link from /etc/resolv.conf to
 /etc/resolvconf/run/resolv.conf. If you choose this option then this
 link will be created; the existing /etc/resolv.conf file will be
 preserved as /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/original, and will be
 restored if this package is removed.
 .
 Declining this option will prevent future installations from
 recreating the symbolic link and therefore the resolver configuration
 file will not be dynamically updated. Dynamic updating can then be
 activated following instructions in the README file.
 .
 The presence of resolvconf can affect the behavior of other programs,
 so it should not be left installed if unconfigured.

Template: resolvconf/downup-interfaces
Type: note
_Description: Network interfaces reconfiguration mandatory
 Once resolvconf is installed, interface configurers supply name server
 information to it (which it then makes available to the C library resolver
 and to DNS caches). However, they do this only when they bring up interfaces.
 Therefore for resolvconf's name server information to be up to date after
 initial installation it is necessary to reconfigure interfaces (that is,
 to take them down and then to bring them up again) and to restart
 DNS caches.

Template: resolvconf/link-tail-to-original
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Append original file to dynamic file?
 If the original static resolver configuration file (/etc/resolv.conf)
 contains name server addresses, those addresses should be listed on
 "dns-nameservers" lines in /etc/network/interfaces. For more
 information, please consult the resolvconf(8) man page and the
 README file.
 .
 Until /etc/network/interfaces has been edited and the affected
 interfaces brought down and up again, the name server addresses will
 not be included in the dynamically generated resolver configuration
 file.
 .
 If you choose this option, a temporary workaround will be put in
 place: a symbolic link will be created (if it does not already exist)
 from /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/tail to
 /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/original. This will cause the whole of
 that original resolver configuration file to be appended to the
 dynamically generated file.
 .
 After the required "dns-nameservers" lines have been added to
 /etc/network/interfaces, the /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/tail link
 should be replaced by one to /dev/null.
